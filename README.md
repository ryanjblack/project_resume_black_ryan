## Resources

Stuff I used on this project:

- [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) for the technical skills section. It's an easy-to-install plug-in and offers a lot of ways to customize your graphs without a lot of coding. I had trouble configuring the size of the fonts, so that's something I will look into in the future.

- [Vide](http://vodkabears.github.io/vide/) lets you use a video as a background on your page. It's as simple as adding the plugin to the js folder and then initializing the video in a tag in your HTML.

- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - this is a fun way to add some animation and fun to the site.

- [FlexBox Models](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) I try to get some practice using flexbox as much as I can and I used it for the formatting on my resume. I think calc is still more powerful and easier for customization but Flexbox offers some very intuitive solutions.

- [Pexel Videos](https://videos.pexels.com/) is where I found the background animation for my site.

## Comments

I was glad to see all of the skills we have been working on come to a head with this assignment. If we did not go over js and jQuery at the length that we did I would have been lost trying to initialize, configure and finish using the plugins that I used on this assignment.
